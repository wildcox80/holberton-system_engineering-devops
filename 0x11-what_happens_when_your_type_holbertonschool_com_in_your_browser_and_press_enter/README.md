## Background Context

Being a Full-Stack Software Engineer means you’re comfortable interacting with any layer of the stack.

A way to easily assess this is to simply ask an engineer to explain how a software system works. They can have a general overview of the flow or can choose to dig deep in a certain area.

Let’s practice by exploring the infrastructure side (network, servers, security…) of the question.


## Requirements

### General :minidisc:


- You can post your blog post on the platform of your choice, LinkedIn or Medium are good ones
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory



## More Info :boom:

### Manual QA Review

It is your responsibility to request a review for your blog from a peer before the project’s deadline. If no peers have been reviewed, you should request a review from a TA or staff member.


## Task :notebook:

### Mandatory :heavy_check_mark:
- What happens when...


### Advanced :red_circle:
- Everything's better with a pretty diagram
- Contribute!
