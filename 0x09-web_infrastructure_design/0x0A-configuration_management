## Learning Objetives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

- You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects
- You must be able to explain what each component is doing
- You must be able to explain system redundancy
- Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

## Requirements

### General :minidisc:


- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram
- This project will be manually reviewed:
- As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
- Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use imgur but feel free to use anything you want).
- For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file
- After pushing your answer file to Github, insert the Github file link into the URL box
- You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session
- Focus on what you are being asked:
- Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project
- Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements
- Similarly in a job interview, you should answer what the interviewer asked for, be careful about being too verbose - always ask the interviewer if going into details is necessary - speaking too much can play against you
- In this project, again, avoid going in details if not asked

 
## Task :notebook:

### Mandatory :heavy_check_mark:

- Simple web stack 
- Distributed web infrastructure
- Secured and monitored web infrastructure

### Advanced :red_circle:

- Scale up
