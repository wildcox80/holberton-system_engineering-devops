## Background Context

Questions involving APIs are common for interviews. Sometimes they’re as simple as ‘write a Python script that queries a given endpoint’, sometimes they require you to use recursive functions and format/sort the results.

A great API to use for some practice is the Reddit API. There’s a lot of endpoints available, many that don’t require any form of authentication, and there’s tons of information to be parsed out and presented. Getting comfortable with API calls now can save you some face during technical interviews and even outside of the job market, you might find personal use cases to make your life a little bit easier.


## Resources :notebook:

Read or watch:

- [Reddit API Documentation](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/odMvR9obKnQCx5EaM6_YFA)

- [Query String](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/KtHEZIjOvJXYtufkJE1r4A)

## Learning Objetives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, **without the help of Google**:

### General :minidisc:

- How to read API documentation to find the endpoints you’re looking for
- How to use an API with pagination
- How to parse JSON results from an API
- How to make a recursive API call
- How to sort a dictionary by value



## Requirements

### General :minidisc:

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- Libraries imported in your Python files must be organized in alphabetical order
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- You must use the Requests module for sending HTTP requests to the Reddit API



## Task :notebook:

### Mandatory :heavy_check_mark:

- How many subs?
- Top Ten
- Recurse it!

### Advanced :heavy_check_mark:
- Count it!
